An alternative wrapper for the [top.gg API](//docs.top.gg)

_Please note, this is **not an official package from top.gg**. We are not
affiliated with top.gg in any way. If you want to install their official
package, please see [their repo](//github.com/top-gg/python-sdk)._

## Introduction

top.py is a python wrapper for the top.gg discord bot list API. top.py aims to
be object-oriented, whereas the official top.gg python SDK is more low-level raw
data.

### Installation

You can install the latest stable release here:

```shell
pip install top.py
```

But, if you're reading this, you're most likely a developer - you should know
how to install packages by now.

### Examples
You can see examples in the [examples.md](https://github.com/dragdev-studios/top.py/blob/master/examples.md) file.
